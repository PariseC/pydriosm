The development of PyDriosm, together with all the example code for demonstrating how to use the package, is mainly built on free `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ data. The author of the package would like to thank all `OpenStreetMap contributors <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contributors>`_ who make the data available for free.
